Welcome to BLOCK BREAKER!
  The goal of the game is to destroy the bricks by using the ball and the paddle. 
    This game was my first real programming challenge, as it involved developing the physics 
    for the ball and power-ups as well as understanding how animation actually worked.
  The game contains different kinds of power-ups, which can be seen below:
        
        
        -            Speeds up the ball   
        
        
        -            Slows down the ball  
        
        
        -            Shortens the paddle
        
        
        -            Elongates the paddle
        
    There is still a lot of work to be done. I'm hoping to
    - Improve the physics and animation
    - Add more power-ups and levels
    - Add a level creator
    - General bug fixing
